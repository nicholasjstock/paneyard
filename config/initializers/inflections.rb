# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, "\\1en"
#   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, "\\1"
#   inflect.irregular "person", "people"
#   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
# end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym "RESTful"
# end

ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
  inflect.irregular "criterion", "criteria"
  # Orchestrator::GitHubAppAuth (app/services/orchestrator/github_app_auth.rb)
  # is named after the product's own "GitHub" capitalization; without this,
  # Zeitwerk's default camelization of "github" expects "Github" instead and
  # eager loading fails at boot.
  inflect.acronym "GitHub"
end
